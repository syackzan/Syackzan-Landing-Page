            <p>
                Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist. Michael Knight, a young loner on a 
                crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless in a world of criminals who operate above the law.

                80 days around the world, we’ll find a pot of gold just sitting where the rainbow’s ending. Time — we’ll fight against the time, and we’ll 
                fly on the white wings of the wind. 80 days around the world, no we won’t say a word before the ship is really back. Round, round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. R
                ound, all around the world. Round, all around the world.

                Mutley, you snickering, floppy eared hound. When courage is needed, you’re never around. Those medals you wear on your moth-eaten 
                chest should be there for bungling at which you are best. So, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that pigeon, stop that 
                pigeon, stop that pigeon. Howwww! Nab him, jab him, tab him, grab him, stop that pigeon now.
